Objectives of Lab 05

To learn how to make decisions in programs using nested if-else statements, like checking scholarships, calculating bills, or identifying shapes.

To understand how nested switch-case statements help handle multiple options in real-life tasks, such as parking fees, food orders, or luggage charges.

To practice using logical operators (&&, ||) to check multiple conditions at once, like verifying ATM transactions or login credentials.

To explore ternary operators for making simple decisions, like calculating bonuses or incentives.

To use math functions from <math.h>—like square root, power, logarithm, and trigonometric functions—for scientific calculations.

To improve problem-solving skills by creating programs that handle input, validate data, and calculate results for practical scenarios.

To gain confidence in writing structured and organized C programs that solve real-world problems efficiently.
